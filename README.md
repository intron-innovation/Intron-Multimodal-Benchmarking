## Overview
This repository contains the analysis scripts and plots for the study "How Good Are Large Language Models at Supporting Frontline Healthcare Worker in Low-Resource Settings – A Benchmarking Study & Dataset." The research focuses on evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in providing clinical support within low-resource healthcare systems, specifically in Nigeria.

The study involved developing a dataset of 9,303 clinical questions from Nigerian community health workers (CHWs).  A subset of these questions had responses generated by SEVERAL LLMs (Gemini-2.0 flash, GPT-4o, phi4-multimodal, Gemma-3-27b, Qwen-2.5, llama-3.3-70b, Qwen2-Audio-7B, llama-4-maverick, o4-mini, Deepseek-R1, GPT-4.1, Claude-4-Sonnet, Qwen2.5-VL-7B) across differrent modalities (text, audio and images). Responses were compared with those from local clinicians.
